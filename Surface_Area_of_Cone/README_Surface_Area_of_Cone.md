/* A C program that calculates the surface area of a cone. A user defined area class, Area(), utilizes the FILE I/O system to open a file pointer to local file, "data", with read file attribute, read both radius and height integer values stored in "data" file and close the file pointer. Area() returns float value back to calling function. A main class uses the same FILE data structure to open file pointer to local file,"data", with write file attribute, prompt user to enter both radius and height values into established variables, write both integer values to file,"data", and close file pointer. Output of main class is the surface area of a cone with user defined radius and height variables. */
