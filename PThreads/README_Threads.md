/* A C program that demonstrates the use of pthreads in C. The program declares a global integer array of size 10 and initialized it with the first 10 natural numbers, declares two golobal integer variables to hold the partial sums of the array, and declares a function named sum to be invoked by threads. The sum function accepts one argument of type void pointer which indicates the starting index to compute the partial sum. Once an argument is passed to the function, the combination of if and else if statements computes the partial sum of the array and stores them in the global integer variables declared previously. In the main function, two pthread_t variables are created to hold thread state information. Function uses pthread_create() and pthread_join() to create two threads and call function, sum. The function prints the cumulative sum of the first 10 natural numbers by adding partial sums. */
