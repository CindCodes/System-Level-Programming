/* A C program that demonstrates structures This C program uses a structure to obtain and display the name, product ID, and weight of the item in order to maintain the inventory at a grocery store and can contain up to a desired number of items. The program declares a structure called item that holds a string of 10 characters called name, a double variable called weight, and an integer called product ID. I created a void getItems() function that takes in two arguments, a pointer to item structure, and integer number of records obtained in main function. The function obtains the name, product ID, and weight of the product by utilizing the pointer arithmetic and -> operator to iterate over the array. I created another void function called printItems() that similar to the previous took in the same two parameters and prints the name of the item, product ID, and weight of each item obtained from the previous function as it iterates through the array of length as long as the number of records you have given.
The main function declares the pointer to the item structure created, obtains the number of items from the user and uses the malloc() function to dynamically allocate memory to store items in the item structure. The main calls the getItems() and and printItems() functions and passes the pointer to the item structure and number of items.
